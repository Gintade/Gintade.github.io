# Web Design Course Final project

A portfolio done for a final project in the **Web Design for Everybody: Basics of Web Development & Coding** Coursera specialization.

It features syntactically correct HTML5 and CSS3, with accessible web design. It is a responsive adaptive web portfolio done from scratch.

PD: That mockup was also designed by me during the specialization.
